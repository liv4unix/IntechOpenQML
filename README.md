# IntechOpenQML
This is the Repository containing the IBM Quantum Cloud Jupyter Notebook for the IntechOpen QML Book Chapter.

####This Notebook is premised on IBM's original QGAN work, found here:
<a href="https://learn.qiskit.org/course/machine-learning/quantum-generative-adversarial-networks"> Building Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with IBM Qiskit </a>

## The experiment section in the book, and the associated Jupyter Notebook update IBM's original and now deprecated QGAN work as follows:

1) Leverage IBM's latest Quantum Sampler Algorithm 
2) Utilize a backend IBM SamplerAER Noise model
3) Optimize the Tensorflow Hyperparameters for the generator and discriminator
