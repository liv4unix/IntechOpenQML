# IntechOpenQML
This is the Repository containing the IBM Quantum Cloud Jupyter Notebook for the IntechOpen QML Book Chapter.

### This Notebook is premised on IBM's original QGAN work, found here:<br>
<a href="https://learn.qiskit.org/course/machine-learning/quantum-generative-adversarial-networks"> Building Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with IBM Qiskit </a>
<br>
### The Experiment section of the QML Chapter of the Book updates IBM's original and now deprecated QGAN work as follows:<br>
1) Leverage IBM's latest Quantum Sampler Algorithm <br>
2) Utilize a backend IBM SamplerAER Noise model<br>
3) Optimize the Tensorflow Hyperparameters for the generator and discriminator
